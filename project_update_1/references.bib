abstract = "This paper presents a systematic analysis of insider attacks against mobile ad-hoc routing protocols, using the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol as an example. It identifies a number of attack goals, and then studies how to achieve these goals through misuses of the routing messages. To facilitate the analysis, it classifies insider attacks into two categories: atomic misuses and compound misuses. Atomic misuses are performed by manipulating a single routing message, which cannot be further divided; compound misuses are composed of combinations of atomic misuses and possibly normal uses of the routing protocol. The analysis results in this paper reveal several classes of insider attacks, including route disruption, route invasion, node isolation, and resource consumption. Finally, this paper presents simulation results that validate and demonstrate the impact of these attacks. "

abstract={Most recent ad hoc network research has focused on providing routing services without considering security. We detail security threats against ad hoc routing protocols, specifically examining AODV and DSR. In light of these threats, we identify three different environments with distinct security requirements. We propose a solution to one, the managed-open scenario where no network infrastructure is pre-deployed, but a small amount of prior security coordination is expected. Our protocol, authenticated routing for ad hoc networks (ARAN), is based on certificates and successfully defeats all identified attacks.},

abstract={Ad hoc networks are a new wireless networking paradigm for mobile hosts. Unlike traditional mobile wireless networks, ad hoc networks do not rely on any fixed infrastructure. Instead, hosts rely on each other to keep the network connected. Military tactical and other security-sensitive operations are still the main applications of ad hoc networks, although there is a trend to adopt ad hoc networks for commercial uses due to their unique properties. One main challenge in the design of these networks is their vulnerability to security attacks. In this article, we study the threats on ad hoc network faces and the security goals to be achieved. We identify the new challenges and opportunities posed by this new networking environment and explore new approaches to secure its communication. In particular, we take advantage of the inherent redundancy in ad hoc networks-multiple routes between nodes-to defend routing against denial-of-service attacks. We also use replication and new cryptographic schemes, such as threshold cryptography, to build a highly secure and highly available key management service, which terms the core of our security framework},

title={Detecting malicious packet dropping using statistically regular traffic patterns in multihop wireless networks that are not bandwidth limited},

volume={5}, 
pages={2957-2961 vol.5}, 
abstract={Ad hoc networks are gaining presence with the proliferation of cheap wireless devices and the need to keep them connected. Individual applications and larger missions, such as those of tactical sensor networks, require secure data transmission among wireless devices. Security remains a major challenge for such networks. Current protocols employ encryption and authentication techniques for secure message exchange, but given the limitations and innately insecure nature of ad-hoc networks, such mechanisms may not suffice. A security breach can, for example, be a network-level denial-of-service (DoS) attack, passive eavesdropping, or physical layer jamming to degrade communication channels. In a multihop network, an intruder node can degrade communication quality by simply dropping packets that are meant to be relayed (forwarded). The network could then misinterpret the cause of packet loss as congestion instead of malicious activity. In this paper, we suggest that traffic transmission patterns be selected to facilitate verification by a receiver. Such traffic patterns are used in concert with suboptimal MAC that preserves the statistical regularity from hop to hop. This general technique for intrusion detection is therefore suitable for networks that are not bandwidth limited but have strict security requirements, e.g., certain kinds of tactical sensor networks.},
